## Introduction
In this assignment from CERN I had three days to come up with a solution to one of the user stories provided. I chose a combination of two of those and added some extra sugar.

## User Stories
There are a couple of user stories that I used. Below they are presented from most important to least important concerning my application.

1. As a user I want certain messages to be pushed as notifications so I don't have to refresh the page. (websocket/backend)
2. As a user I want to receive notifications via alerts/flshcards so I can easily receive notifications without using sreen real estate.
3. As a user I want a simple but user friendly way to add or change tags so logs and threads are easier to filter/search through.
